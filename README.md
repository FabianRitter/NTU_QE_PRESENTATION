**<u>Main take aways I hope you could learn/obtain from my slides</u>:
**
1) Keep the slides with loss of Figures and not much text.
2) Start from the bigger picture and then develop into the forming motivation of your problem or contribution. Eg: I described SSL and how to train SSL models, I then moved to the landscape and how such models have grown on model size. Then I try to answer: What is the problem with this model size growth? , What has been done? Why such approaches are not good enough?. Then I move into how my proposal fits into this problem landscape and which aspects in particular is targetting.
3) Once you finish your first contribution, then recap the general landscape of your research and which new aspect is the second contribution tackling from this general landscape.
4) Remember to summarize your contributions at the end of the presentation.
5) Remember to establish the future work and how it is linked to what you have done so far.
