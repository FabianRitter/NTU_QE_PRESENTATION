**<ins>Main take aways I hope you could learn/obtain from my slides</ins>:**

1) Keep the slides with lots of Figures and not much text.
2) Start from the bigger picture and then develop into the forming motivation of your problem or contribution. Eg: I described SSL, how SSL models are trained and how they differ from supervised learning. Then I explained why SSL models are important, once the importance of this method is cleared, I then moved to the landscape and how such models have grown on model size. Then I try to answer: What is the problem with this model size growth?,If this is a problem, then, what has been done? Why such approaches are not good enough?. Then I move into how my proposal fits into this problem landscape and which aspects in particular is targetting.
3) After this you can present the details of your contribution ideally with Figures.
4) Once you finish your first contribution, then recap the general landscape of your research and which new aspect is the second contribution tackling from this general landscape. Try to connect both contributions under the same landscape.
5) Remember to summarize all your contributions at the end of the presentation.
6) Remember to establish the future work and how it is linked to what you have done so far.
